# PwC-Call-Centre-Analysis-PowerBi

Visualising customer and agent behaviour.

I enjoyed working on this project because it gave me insight into how callers and call agents manage their time across various departments.

This PowerBi dashboard reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset.

• Overall customer satisfaction 
• Overall calls answered/abandoned 
• Calls by time 
• Average speed of answer 
• Agent’s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered
